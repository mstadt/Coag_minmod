# Coag_minmod
 Evolutionary model of coagulation with lamprey and mammal model

driver_lamprey.m run to simulate lamprey version of the model
driver_mammal.m run to simulate mammal version of the model

# Plotting functions
plotTbMetrics_varyingFlow.m - vary flow and output four metrics of coag evolutionary model
plotTb_varyingFlow.m - plot timecourse thrombin and compare lamprey and mammal for varying k_F 
plotTb_varyingTFVIIa.m - plot timecourse thrombin and compare lamprey and mammal for varying TF:VIIa
